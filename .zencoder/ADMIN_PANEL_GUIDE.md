## 🔧 Backend API Endpoints

All admin operations use these protected endpoints:

### Bodies of Work
```
GET    /bodies              - List all (public)
GET    /bodies/admin        - List all (admin)
GET    /bodies/:id          - Get one (public)
POST   /bodies              - Create (admin)
PATCH  /bodies/:id          - Update (admin)
DELETE /bodies/:id          - Delete (admin)
```

### Artworks
```
GET    /artworks            - List all (public)
GET    /artworks?bodyId=id  - Filter by body (public)
GET    /artworks/admin      - List all (admin)
GET    /artworks/:id        - Get one (public)
POST   /artworks            - Create (admin)
PATCH  /artworks/:id        - Update (admin)
DELETE /artworks/:id        - Delete (admin)
```

### Music
```
GET    /music               - List all (public)
GET    /music/admin         - List all (admin)
GET    /music/:id           - Get one (public)
POST   /music               - Create (admin)
PATCH  /music/:id           - Update (admin)
DELETE /music/:id           - Delete (admin)
```

### Contact
```
POST   /contact             - Submit (public)
GET    /contact             - List all (admin)
PATCH  /contact/:id/read    - Mark as read (admin)
DELETE /contact/:id         - Delete (admin)
```

### Upload
```
POST   /upload/image        - Upload image (admin)
```

## 🔐 Security

### Authentication
- JWT token required for all admin operations
- Token stored in localStorage
- Automatic logout on token expiration
- JWT guard on all protected routes

### Authorization
- All endpoints require `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)`
- Only logged-in users can access admin panel
- Login page accessible to anyone
- Public endpoints (view gallery, etc.) available without login

### Data Protection
- Image uploads validated for file type
- File size limits enforced (10MB)
- SQL injection prevented via Mongoose
- CORS configured for localhost

---

## 💾 Data Persistence

### Database
- MongoDB stores all admin data
- Collections: bodies, artworks, music, contacts, users
- Automatic timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)
- Unique IDs (MongoDB ObjectId)

### Image Storage
- Uploaded images stored in `/backend/uploads/images/`
- Filenames generated with timestamp + random
- Served as static files via `/uploads/`
- Referenced in artwork records

### Backup Considerations
- Regular MongoDB backups recommended
- Images backed up with database
- Version control for code changes
- Git tracks all component changes

---

## 🚀 Performance

### Lazy Loading
- Admin sections loaded on-demand
- Reduces initial bundle size
- Each admin tab is separate chunk

### Optimization
- Material tables virtualize large datasets
- Pagination can be added later if needed
- Images optimized in upload
- Efficient Angular change detection

### Bundling
```
bodies-admin:      ~11 KB (gzipped)
artworks-admin:    ~56 KB (gzipped)
music-admin:       ~13 KB (gzipped)
contacts-admin:    ~17 KB (gzipped)
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Image Upload Not Working
```
✓ Check file size (< 10MB)
✓ Check file type (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)

```

### Can't Save Changes
```
✓ Check you're logged in (not expired)
✓ Check backend is running
✓ Check network tab in DevTools
✓ Check console for error messages
✓ Try refreshing the page
```

### Dialog Won't Close
```
✓ Click outside dialog to cancel
✓ Click "Cancel" button
✓ Press Escape key
✓ Check console for JavaScript errors
```

### Data Not Appearing
```
✓ Click "Refresh" button (contacts)
✓ Reload page (F5)
✓ Check backend logs
✓ Verify data in MongoDB
✓ Check browser console for errors
```
