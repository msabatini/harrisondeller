# 🔧 Setup Issues Found & Fixed

## Issue #1: Missing Frontend Dependency ⚠️ FIXED

### Problem
**Frontend build failed** with error:
```
✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve "@angular/animations/browser"
```

### Root Cause
The `@angular/animations` package was missing from `package.json` even though Angular Material and other components depend on it.

### Solution Applied ✅
```bash
npm install @angular/animations@20.3.0 --save --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Result
- ✅ Frontend now builds successfully
- ✅ All lazy-loaded routes compile
- ✅ Dev server starts without errors
- ✅ `package.json` updated with new dependency

### Files Modified
- `frontend/package.json` - Added `"@angular/animations": "^20.3.0"`
- `frontend/package-lock.json` - Updated locks

- ✅ 8 modules loaded
- ✅ 35+ routes registered
- ✅ Listening on port 3000

### Frontend
- ✅ Dependencies installed (372 packages) 
- ✅ Builds cleanly
- ✅ Starts dev server
- ✅ Hot reload active

## How to Start Development Now

### Terminal 1 - Backend
```bash
cd /Users/michaelsabatini/Documents/harrisondeller/backend
npm run start:dev
```
**Expected output:** `Nest application successfully started`

### Terminal 2 - Frontend
```bash
cd /Users/michaelsabatini/Documents/harrisondeller/frontend
npm start
```
**Expected output:** `Local: http://localhost:4200/`

### Terminal 3 - Verify Connection
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/bodies
```
**Expected output:** JSON array of bodies (empty initially)

## Notes for Future Reference

1. **If frontend won't build again:**
   - Run `npm install` in frontend directory
   - Check that `@angular/animations` is in `package.json`

2. **If backend won't start:**
   - Verify MongoDB is running: `brew services list | grep mongodb`
   - Check port 3000 isn't in use: `lsof -i :3000`

3. **If you see "Port in use" errors:**
   - Kill existing processes: `pkill -f "nest start"` or `pkill -f "ng serve"`
   - Try again with: `npm run start:dev` or `npm start`

4. **SMTP Configuration:**
   - Currently uses placeholders
   - For production, update with real Gmail app password
   - See `backend/.env` for configuration

5. **JWT Secret:**
   - Currently set to: `your-secret-key-change-this-in-production`
   - Change before production deployment
